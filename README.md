## Total Riding Popularity (by month and by hour)
The more popular months seem to be in the warmer months of the year. This would make sense as people would be more likely to use Citi Bikes in warmer weather compared to colder weather. We can also see that 5pm is the busiest time of the day when combining all months, and 4am is the slowest time. Within the hour-by-hour breakdown, there is an option to isolate individual months for a more detailed analysis.

## Members vs Casual Riders
We can clearly see that there are far more members who use Citi Bikes compared to non-members (casual). This is shown in the month-by-month graph, the hour-by-hour graph and the interactive map.

## Most Popular Stations
This is a way to show the most popular stations all the way down to the least popular stations. We can observe this with both graphs (starting stations and ending stations) by scrolling and viewing the most and least used stations. The map can also be used to view the locations and exact count recorded at each station.
